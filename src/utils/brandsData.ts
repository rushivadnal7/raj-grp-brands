              <p>Rajol White Oils are high-purity, severely refined mineral oils / liquid paraffins that consist of saturated aliphatic and alicyclic nonpolar hydrocarbons. These oils are hydrophobic, colourless, odourless, tasteless, biologically stable, and non-carcinogenic. These properties make white oils the standard in many industries. RAJOL White Oils conform to the most recent requirements of Pharmacopoeia (USP, BP, Ph. Eur, IP) and FDA monographs (USFDA). Custom-made White Oils catering to specific application requirements can be formulated on request. These oils are manufactured in GMP-certified, Kosher & Halal registered, ISO 9001:2015, 14001:2015, OHSAS 18001:2007 certified facilities.</p>

              <p>Rajprol Rubber Processing Oils are superior blends of aromatic and aliphatic components designed for the processing of rubber and related polymers. Rajprol Oils are classified as Aromatic, Paraffinic, Naphthenic, and Special Grades depending on the chemical nature of the predominant constituent. </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration:underline; margin-top: 16px;"> AROMATIC PROCESS OILS </h1>
                <p>Aromatic Process Oils have higher solvency and superior compatibility with most rubber polymers. These oils exhibit low volatility and high viscosity for improved productivity and safety standards. </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration:underline ; margin-top: 10px;">PARAFFINIC PROCESS OILS </h1>
                <p>Paraffinic Process Oils are highly refined oils that have low solvency and high aniline point with low aromaticity, excellent colour, oxidation & thermal stability, and also elastomer compatibility. </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration:underline; margin-top: 10px;">NAPHTHENIC PROCESS OILS </h1>
                <p>Naphthenic Process Oils exhibit high solvency, good thermal stability, excellent compatibility, and non-staining properties. </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration:underline; margin-top: 10px;">SPECIAL GRADE PROCESS OILS </h1>
                <p>Special Grades Process Oils are produced by blending of judiciously selected base stocks, resulting in oils of specific characteristics. These series of oils are guaranteed to meet with Poly Cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) limits specified by 1907/2006/EC, Annex XVII, Entry 50 (REACH), formerly EU directive 200/69/EC. </p>

                <p>RAWAX will migrate to the surface of the cured rubber depending on the ambient temperature and the molecular weight and complexity of the wax components present in the blend. RAWAX products can be designed to protect at specific temperatures or to operate over a wider temperature range. RAWAX offers improved mixing efficiency, reduces batch cycle times, and ensures controlled migration characteristics to minimize excess bloom. RAWAX products are used in the Natural Rubber and Synthetic Polymers industry. </p>
